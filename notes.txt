Iâ€™ve made a preview here: http://www.en-silence.be/pauline2.html
But lots of things are simulated or wrong so can you please code the website from the instructions bellow?
I hope it helps to understand anyway the italic effect and background image (by rolling over PSYCHANALYSE ET PSYCHOTHERAPIE, even though it actually has to be when rollover the main text)

____


- Image appears when rollover the main text. 
- Each sentences separately in italic when rollover (they all have the same effect with the background image)
- Image should be full width and cropped 60px above and bellow the main text
- Fade in and fade out of the image: 5scd
